# [FindMyDoctor By Walid Braham] - www.wbraham.me

This is a MEAN Stack web app, which lets you search for the nearest doctor in your region. I have used a Tunisian Doctors Database for this, which I got through a Web Crawler (Link below).

## Features:

- Search for Tunisian Doctors By Region, Name & Speciality.
- Made it a PWA.

## TODO LIST :

[X] Update my profile.

[X] Fix GPS Integration with Progressive Web Apps.

[X] Possibility to rate a doctor.
